# Scientific Programming Scripts
# These scripts do a variety of things related to programming for the Behavioral Sciences.
# Some scripts just process and clean already existing data, others replicate existing experimental paradigms in Psychology, others are simple demonstrations of processes like Fourrier Analysis.
# All assignments were done in MATLAB 2015b with the exception of number 10 which replicates Assignment 1 in a Jupyter notebook.
